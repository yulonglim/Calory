Motivation 

When you feel inactive after being trapped indoors for entire days and feel like leading a more active lifestyle, your current option is to search online for workout routines. However, there is so much information on the internet that you get confused on which to refer to, or you try a workout routine and realise itâ€™s not suited for you. Moreover, these workout routines are not displayed in a structured manner that allows for you to develop a fitness routine. As such, you are unable to reach any of your fitness goals due to a lack of motivation and structure. As such, we present the ExerciseLah! application. 


Aim 

We hope to enable more people to start their exercise journey, by removing the initial friction that comes with not knowing how to do so effectively. We aim to encourage people to develop and maintain structured exercise routines, in a way that is tailored to their individual abilities.

User Stories

1. As a sports beginner, I want suggestions on what kind of workout I can start on to begin my workout journey.

2. As a sports beginner who would like to reach a certain fitness goal, I want to set my goals and get recommendations on how to fulfil it.

3. As a sports beginner, I want to track my training progress over time as I work towards achieving my goals.

4. As a sports beginner, I want to have my workout plans recalibrated if I happen to miss days of exercise

How are we different from similar platforms?

- Exercise Trackers (e.g. RunKeeper, Nike Training Club)
More suitable for athletes with the discipline to keep up with regular trainings, whereas our app focuses on motivating sports beginners to kickstart their fitness journey

- Habit Tracker
Helps to track habits, which can include exercise. However, these apps do not recommend exercise routines for the user to reduce the friction for them to begin exercising
